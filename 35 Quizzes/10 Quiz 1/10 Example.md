# Quiz

During the quiz, you are allowed to use one (1) sheet of A4 paper containing
written or typed notes on any subject, and a pen, nothing else.

You are to write your solutions on paper, in pseudocode or in real Java(TM),
and you do not need to remember or specify which libraries to `import` to use
special functions. You can use any library that is used in problem sets 1--3.
Any external methods you use must actually exist, of course!
