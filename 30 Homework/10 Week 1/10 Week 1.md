# Homework

Your homework each week will consist of reading book chapters. You should do
this fairly quickly. You do not need to remember everything, just read it
lightly, make some notes and because it's in your head you will have an easier
time doing the assignments.

Besides that, there are nice video lectures that will help you get started with
all of the concepts you need to know to get programming. They do not always
correspond one-on-one to the book, so make sure to do both.

Availability of the book is explained on the [homepage](/).

## How to do the note taking

* You should mark all sections that you find hard to understand.
* You should write down, in your book or separately, any questions that pop up during reading.
* You must bring your book with you, including notes, to all lab sessions.

You must bring the syllabus with your notes to each lab session. That way, you 
can ask the assistents about any of sections you marked or questions you wrote 
down. *Make sure to use this option!*

If you already have some programming experience, the assignment above may not yield a lot of notes. In that case, you can:

* Mark anything that is different from the programming language you have previously used.
* Take note of anything that you would like to know more about.

You are strongly encouraged to read the chapters again during the week, because
they may not make sense immediately without practice. If you re-read them, you will need almost no time preparing for the quizzes.
