# Problem Set 3: Hangman

For this assignment, your mission is to write a program that plays the game of
Hangman.

## Objectives

- Practice string manipulation.
- Have a try at file I/O.
- Start using `ArrayList`s.
- Acquaint you with modularizing software into multiple classes.

## Recommended Reading

Review these chapters if needed; they cover important concepts from last week. If you skim them a little, you may be able to use them as a good reference when writing your programs! However, before anything else, best to watch this week's lectures!

- ["Strings and things"](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/html/thinkjava010.html) from Think Java
- ["Create your own objects"](http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/html/thinkjava013.html) from Think Java

The chapter below contains useful information on debugging. You will need this in class!

## Academic Honesty

This course's philosophy on academic honesty is best stated as "be reasonable." The course recognizes that interactions with classmates and others can facilitate mastery of the course's material. However, there remains a line between enlisting the help of another and submitting the work of another. This policy characterizes both sides of that line.

The essence of all work that you submit to this course must be your own. Collaboration on problem sets is not permitted except to the extent that you may ask classmates and others for help so long as that help does not reduce to another doing your work for you. Generally speaking, when asking for help, you may show your code to others, but you may not view theirs, so long as you and they respect this policy's other constraints. Collaboration on quizzes is not permitted at all.

Below are rules of thumb that (inexhaustively) characterize acts that the course considers reasonable and not reasonable. If in doubt as to whether some act is reasonable, do not commit it until you solicit and receive approval in writing from the course's heads. Acts considered not reasonable by the course are handled harshly.

If you commit some act that is not reasonable but bring it to the attention of the course's heads within 72 hours, the course may impose local sanctions that may include an unsatisfactory or failing grade for work submitted, but the course will not refer the matter to the Examinations Board.

### Reasonable

* Communicating with classmates about problem sets' problems in English (or some other spoken language).
* Discussing the course's material with others in order to understand it better.
* Helping a classmate identify a bug in his or her code at the lab, elsewhere, or even online, as by viewing, compiling, or running his or her code, even on your own computer.
* Incorporating snippets of code that you find online or elsewhere into your own code, provided that those snippets are *not* themselves (partial) solutions to assigned problems and that you cite the snippets' origins.
* Reviewing past years' quizzes and solutions thereto.
* Sending or showing code that you've written to someone, possibly a classmate, so that he or she might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Sharing snippets of your own code online so that others might help you identify and fix a bug.
* Turning to the web or elsewhere for instruction beyond the course's own, for references, and for solutions to technical difficulties, but not for outright solutions to problem set's problems.
* Whiteboarding solutions to problem sets with others using diagrams or pseudocode but not actual code.
* Working with (and even paying) a tutor to help you with the course, provided the tutor does not do your work for you.

### Not Reasonable

* Accessing a solution to some problem prior to (re-)submitting your own.
* Asking a classmate to see his or her solution to a problem set's problem before (re-)submitting your own.
* Decompiling, deobfuscating, or disassembling the staff's solutions to problem sets.
* Failing to cite (as with comments) the origins of code or techniques that you discover outside of the course's own lessons and integrate into your own work, even while respecting this policy's other constraints.
* Giving or showing to a classmate a solution to a problem set's problem when it is he or she, and not you, who is struggling to solve it.
* Looking at another individual's work during a quiz.
* Paying or offering to pay an individual for work that you may submit as (part of) your own.
* Providing or making available solutions to problem sets to individuals who might take this course in the future.
* Searching for, soliciting, or viewing a quiz's questions or answers prior to taking the quiz.
* Searching for or soliciting outright solutions to problem sets online or elsewhere.
* Splitting a problem set's workload with another individual and combining your work.
* Submitting (after possibly modifying) the work of another individual beyond allowed snippets.
* Submitting the same or similar work to this course that you have submitted or will submit to another.
* Submitting work to this course that you intend to use outside of the course (e.g., for a job) without prior approval from the course's heads.
* Using resources during a quiz beyond those explicitly allowed in the quiz's instructions.
* Viewing another's solution to a problem set's problem and basing your own solution on it.

## Assessment

Your work on this problem set will be evaluated along four axes primarily.

Scope
: To what extent does your code implement the features required by our specification?

Correctness
: To what extent is your code consistent with our specifications and free of bugs?

Design
: To what extent is your code written well (i.e., clearly, efficiently, elegantly, and/or logically)?

Style
: To what extent is your code readable (i.e., commented and indented with variables aptly named)?

All students must ordinarily submit this and all other problem sets to be
eligible for a satisfactory grade unless granted an exception in writing by the
course's heads.
