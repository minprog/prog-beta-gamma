# Karel the Robot

"Karel is a very simple robot living in a very simple world. By giving Karel a
set of commands, you can direct it to perform certain tasks within its
world. The process of specifying those commands is called
programming. Initially, Karel understands only a very small number of predefined
commands, but an important part of the programming process is teaching Karel new
commands that extend its capabilities".[^1]

## Getting started

* Go into the **Dropbox** directory you made in the Getting Started by executing

       cd Dropbox

* Create another directory for this problem set (**mkdir pset1**) and **cd** into
  that as well.

* You can get the starter kit [here](cdn://pset1.zip). To download via the
  Terminal, run **wget \<url of zip\>**.

* Unpack it in the current directory with **unzip pset1.zip**.

* Compile all your source files by issuing the **make** command. If everything
  went well, you get no errors.

* Try running the first problem using

       java -cp .:karel.jar StoneMasonKarel

  This runs the StoneMasonKarel class. But alas, nothing happens if your
  press *run* of course, because you still have to implement the code!

* Now, when in the **pset1** directory, run the following command to start your
  editor and get programming!

> You cannot use any other constructs in your programs than those mentioned on
the last page of the Karel book (cheat sheet!). All of these exercises are
designed to be solvable without the use of variables. Also, you should *not* use
recursion, so as to practice with iterative solutions.

## About the use of Java

You cannot use any other constructs in your programs than those mentioned on
the last page of the Karel book (cheat sheet!). All of these exercises are
designed to be solvable without the use of variables.

Also, you should not use recursion, in order to practice with iterative solutions. You have done enough recursion in the Logic Programming course!

## Problem 1

Your first task is to solve a simple story-problem in Karel’s world. Suppose
that Karel has settled into its house, which is the square area in the center of
the following diagram:

![](figure1.png)

Karel starts off in the northwest corner of its house as shown in the
diagram. The problem you need to get Karel to solve is to collect the
newspaper—represented (as all objects in Karel’s world are) by a beeper—from
outside the doorway and then to return to its initial position.

This exercise is extremely simple and exists just to get you started. You can
assume that every part of the world looks just as it does in the diagram. The
house is exactly this size, the door is always in the position shown, and the
beeper is just outside the door. Thus, all you have to do is write the sequence
of commands necessary to have Karel

1. Move to the newspaper,
2. Pick it up, and
3. Return to its starting point.

Even though the program is only a few lines, it is still worth getting at least
a little practice in decomposition. In your solution, include a private method
for each of the steps shown in the outline.

Implement your solution in the file `CollectNewspaperKarel.java` that is
provided in the starter kit.


## Problem 2

Karel has been hired to repair the damage done to the Quad in the 1989
earthquake. In particular, Karel is to repair a set of arches where some of the
stones (represented by beepers, of course) are missing from the columns
supporting the arches, as follows:

![](figure2.png)

Your program should work on the world shown above, but it should be general
enough to handle any world that meets certain basic conditions as outlined at
the end of this problem. There are several example worlds in the starter folder,
and your program should work correctly with all of them.

When Karel is done, the missing stones in the columns should be replaced by
beepers, so that the final picture resulting from the world shown above would
look like this:

![](figure3.png)

Karel may count on the following facts about the world:

* Karel starts at 1st Avenue and 1st Street, facing east, with an infinite
  number of beepers.
* The columns are exactly four units apart, on 1st, 5th, 9th Avenue, and so
  forth.
* The end of the columns is marked by a wall immediately after the final
  column. This wall section appears after 13th Avenue in the example, but your
  program should work for any number of columns.
* The top of the column is marked by a wall, but Karel cannot assume that
  columns are always five units high, or even that all columns are the same
  height.
* Some of the corners in the column may already contain beepers representing
  stones that are still in place. Your program should not put a second beeper on
  these corners.

Implement your solution in `StoneMasonKarel.java`.


## Problem 3

In this exercise, your job is to get Karel to create a checkerboard pattern of
beepers inside an empty rectangular world, as illustrated in the following
before-and-after diagram:

![](figure4.png)

This problem has a nice decomposition structure along with some interesting
algorithmic issues. As you think about how you will solve the problem, you
should make sure that your solution works with checkerboards that are different
in size from the standard 8 x 8 checkerboard shown in the example. Odd-sized
checkerboards are tricky, and you should make sure that your program generates
the following pattern in a 5 x 3 world:

![](figure5.png)

Another special case you need to consider is that of a world which is only one
column wide or one row high. The starter folder contains several sample worlds
that test these special cases, and you should make sure that your program works
for each of them.

Implement your solution in `CheckerboardKarel.java`.


## Problem 4

As an exercise in solving algorithmic problems, program Karel to place a single
beeper at the center of 1st Street. For example, if Karel starts in the world

![](figure6.png)

it should end with Karel standing on a beeper in the following position:

![](figure7.png)

Note that the final configuration of the world should have only a single beeper
at the midpoint of 1st Street. Along the way, Karel is allowed to place
additional beepers wherever it wants to, but must pick them all up again before
it finishes.

In solving this problem, you may count on the following facts about the world:

* Karel starts at 1st Avenue and 1st Street, facing east, with an infinite
  number of beepers in its bag.
* The initial state of the world includes no interior walls or beepers.
* The world need not be square, but you may assume that it is at least as tall
  as it is wide.

Your program, moreover, can assume the following simplifications:

* If the width of the world is odd, Karel must put the beeper in the center
  square. If the width is even, Karel may drop the beeper on either of the two
  center squares.
* It does not matter which direction Karel is facing at the end of the run.

There are many different algorithms you can use to solve this problem. The
interesting part of this assignment is to come up with a strategy that works.

Implement your solution in `MidpointFindingKarel.java`.

## Problem 5

In this exercise you are going to make Karel solve mazes. A maze in the world of
Karel looks like this:

![A maze in the world of Karel.](figure8.png)

The exits of a maze are marked by a beeper. You can assume these are the only
beepers in the world. Placing extra beepers is allowed, but take care not to
confuse these with the real exits!

The files include five mazes, numbered 1 through 5. Your solution should be a
single class, `MazeSolvingKarel`, which can move Karel to the exit of the first
two mazes.
