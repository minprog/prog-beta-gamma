# Handing in your work

Below are the instructions to hand in your work.

## Adding comments

The problems in this problem set do not usually require a lot of
comments. We would like to see, however, atop each function, a short description
of what it does.

	// this is a comment that describes the line(s) below

And finally, make very sure that your files include a short top comment
describing what the program does, and your name!

	/*
	 * RandomWalkKarel
	 *
	 * Lets Karel walk some steps.
     *
     * A Student, 811028
	 */

## Submitting your work

* You can make a zip with the required files by running the following command
  in a terminal.

        make submit

  You can submit the resulting **zip** file at the bottom of this page.
    
> You can always submit a problem set multiple times. We will grade the very last
  submission *before* the deadline. Make sure to always submit all files, even
  when re-submitting, not only the files that changed!
