# Simple Java Programs

Your job in this assignment is to write programs to solve each of these problems.

## Getting started

Download the starter kit from [here](cdn://pset2.zip) and extract it in your
prog directory. All the files needed for this problem set are included.

## Problem 1

Write a `GraphicsProgram` subclass that draws a pyramid consisting of bricks
arranged in horizontal rows, so that the number of bricks in each row decreases
by one as you move up the pyramid, as shown in the following sample run:

![](simplejava1.png)

The pyramid should be centered at the bottom of the window and should use
constants for the following parameters:

| variable         | description                           |
|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| `BRICK_WIDTH`    | The width of each brick (30 pixels)   |
| `BRICK_HEIGHT`   | The height of each brick (12 pixels)  |
| `BRICKS_IN_BASE` | The number of bricks in the base (12) |

A constant is declared by preceding the variable with the keywords `final` and
`static`. Constants are usually declared at class level, right below the opening
brace. See the example below.

~~~ java
public class Pyramid extends GraphicsProgram
{
    static final int BRICK_WIDTH = 30;
}
~~~

The numbers in parentheses show the values for this diagram, but you must be
able to change those values in your program.

## Problem 2

Write a `GraphicsProgram` subclass that draws a rainbow that looks like this:

![](simplejava2.png)

The colors of the stripes are clear in the web version of the picture, but are
hard to see in the black-and-white handout. Starting at the top, the six arcs
are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and magenta, respectively; cyan makes a
lovely color for the sky.  At first glance, it might seem as if you need to draw
arcs on the screen, even though you won’t actually learn about the `GArc` class
until Lecture 10. As it turns out, that class doesn’t really help much. The
program that produced the diagram shown at the bottom of the previous page uses
only circles, although seeing how this is possible forces you to think outside
the box—in a literal rather than a figurative sense. The common center for each
circle is some distance below the bottom of the window, and the diameters of the
circles are wider than the screen. The `GraphicsProgram` shows only the part of
the figure that actually appears in the window. This process of reducing a
picture to the visible area is called clipping.

Rather than specify the exact dimensions of each circle, play around with the
sizes and positioning of the circles until you get something that matches your
aesthetic sensibilities. The only things we’ll be concerned about are:

* The top of the arc should not be off the screen.
* Each of the arcs in the rainbow should get clipped along the sides of the top,
  and not along the bottom.

## Problem 3

Write a `GraphicsProgram` subclass that draws a partial diagram of the
acm.graphics class hierarchy, as follows:

![](simplejava3.png)

The only classes you need to create this picture are `GRect`, `GLabel`, and
`GLine`. The tricky part is specifying the coordinates so that the different
elements of the picture are aligned properly. The aspects of the alignment for
which you are responsible are:

* The width and height of the class boxes should be specified as named constants
  so that they are easy to change.
* The labels should be centered in their boxes. You can find the width of a
  label by calling `label.getWidth()` and the height it extends above the
  baseline by calling `label.getAscent()`. If you want to center a label, you
  need to shift its origin by half of these distances in each direction.
* The connecting lines should start and end at the center of the appropriate
  edge of the box.
* The entire figure should be centered in the window.

## Problem 4

In high-school algebra, you learned that the standard quadratic equation

$$ax^2 + bx + c = 0$$

has two solutions given by the formula

$$x = \frac{-b \pm \sqrt{b^2 - 4ac} }{2a}$$

The first solution is obtained by using + in place of ±; the second is obtained
by using - in place of ±. Most of this expression contains simple operators
covered in Chapter 2.7 of *Java: How to Program*. The one piece that’s missing
is taking square roots, which you can do by calling the standard function
`Math.sqrt`. For example, the statement `double y = Math.sqrt(x);` sets `y` to
the square root of `x`.

Write a `ConsoleProgram` that accepts values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, and then
calculates the two solutions (which may both be the same). If the quantity under
the square root sign is negative, the equation has no real solutions, and your
program should display a message to that effect. You may assume that the value
for a is nonzero. Your program should be able to duplicate the following sample
run:

    Enter coefficients for the quadratic equation:
    a: 1
    b: -5
    c: 6
    The first solution is 3.0
    The second solution is 2.0

See [here](http://jtf.acm.org/javadoc/student/acm/program/ConsoleProgram.html)
for the documentation of `ConsoleProgram`.

## Problem 5

Write a `ConsoleProgram` that reads in a list of integers, one per line, until a
sentinel value of 0 (which you should be able to change easily to some other
value). When the sentinel is read, your program should display the smallest and
largest values in the list, as illustrated in this sample run:

    This program finds the smallest and largest integers
    in a list. Enter values, one per line, using a 0
    to signal the end of the list.
    ? 17
    ? 42
    ? 11
    ? 19
    ? 35
    ? 0
    The smallest value is 11
    The largest value is 42

Your program should handle the following special cases:

* If the user enters only one value before the sentinel, the program should
  report that value as both the largest and smallest.
* If the user enters the sentinel on the very first input line, then no values
  have been entered, and your program should display a message to that effect.

## Problem 6

Douglas Hofstadter’s Pulitzer-prize-winning book *Gödel, Escher,
Bach*. Hofstadter’s book contains many interesting mathematical puzzles, many of
which can be expressed in the form of computer programs. Of these, most require
programming skills well beyond the second week of this course. However, in
Chapter XII, Hofstadter mentions a wonderful problem that is well within the
scope of the covered control statements. The problem can be expressed as
follows:

1. Pick some positive integer and call it *n*.  
2. If *n* is even, divide it by two.  
3. If *n* is odd, multiply it by three and add one.  
4. Continue this process until *n* is equal to one.  

On page 401 of the Vintage edition, Hofstadter illustrates this process with the
following example, starting with the number 15:

    15 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 46
    46 is even, so I take half: 23
    23 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 70
    70 is even, so I take half: 35
    35 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 106
    106 is even, so I take half: 53
    53 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 160
    160 is even, so I take half: 80
    80 is even, so I take half: 40
    40 is even, so I take half: 20
    20 is even, so I take half: 10
    10 is even, so I take half: 5
    5 is odd, so I make 3n + 1: 16
    16 is even, so I take half: 8
    8 is even, so I take half: 4
    4 is even, so I take half: 2
    2 is even, so I take half: 1
    
As you can see from this example, the numbers go up and down, but eventually—at
least for all numbers that have ever been tried—comes down to end in 1. In some
respects, this process is reminiscent of the formation of hailstones, which get
carried upward by the winds over and over again before they finally descend to
the ground. Because of this analogy, this sequence of numbers is usually called
the **Hailstone sequence**, although it goes by many other names as well.

Write a `ConsoleProgram` that reads in a number from the user and then displays
the Hailstone sequence for that number, just as in Hofstadter’s book, followed
by a line showing the number of steps taken to reach 1. For example, your
program should be able to produce a sample run that looks like this:

    This program computes Hailstone sequences.
    Enter a number: 17
    17 is odd, so I make 3n+1 = 52
    52 is even, so I take half = 26
    26 is even, so I take half = 13
    13 is odd, so I make 3n+1 = 40
    40 is even, so I take half = 20
    20 is even, so I take half = 10
    10 is even, so I take half = 5
    5 is odd, so I make 3n+1 = 16
    16 is even, so I take half = 8
    8 is even, so I take half = 4
    4 is even, so I take half = 2
    2 is even, so I take half = 1
    The process took 12 steps to reach 1.

The fascinating thing about this problem is that no one has yet been able to
prove that it always stops. The number of steps in the process can certainly get
very large. How many steps, for example, does your program take when *n* is 27?
